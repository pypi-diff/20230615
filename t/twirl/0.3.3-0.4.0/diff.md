 from astropy.io import fits
 from astropy import units as u
 from astropy.coordinates import SkyCoord
 
-# Open some FITS image:

+# Open some FITS image
+hdu = fits.open("...")[0]
 
-# Provide the center as a SkyCoord object:
+# get the center of the image
+ra, dec = hdu.header["RA"], hdu.header["DEC"]
 center = SkyCoord(ra, dec, unit=["deg", "deg"])
 
-center = [center.ra.value, center.dec.value]
+# and the size of its field of view
+pixel = 0.66 * u.arcsec  # known pixel scale
+shape = hdu.data.shape
+fov = np.max(shape) * pixel.to(u.deg)
+```
 
-# Utilise the image shape and pixel size in arcseconds " to obtain the field of view in degrees:
-shape = data.shape
+We can then query the gaia stars in the field using this information
 
-# Pixel size in arcseconds:
-pixel = 0.66 * u.arcsec
+```python
+import twirl
 
-# Field of view in degrees:
-fov = np.max(shape)*pixel.to(u.deg).value
+sky_coords = twirl.gaia_radecs(center, 1.2 * fov)[0:12]
 ```
 
-From here, we can pass the data, the center equatorial coordinate and the field-of-view to twirl to compute the World Coordinate System (WCS):

                   [github] [license] [paper] [documentation]
 twirl is an astrometric plate solving package for Python. It is suited for
 cases where the Right Ascension and Declination (RA, dec) coordinates of the
 image center and the field of view is known, computing a World Coordinate
 System (WCS) based on GAIA reference stars. twirl compute a WCS following these
 steps: 1. detection of stars in the image if not provided 2. catalog query
 using image known center 3. asterisms building and matching 4. image
 recombination and wcs fit using astropy.wcs Astersisms are made of 3 or 4
